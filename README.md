# React Assignment

Created a react application which provides following functionalities:

- list users in a table
- search for a user
- sort columns of table
- pagination of users list
- detail page for each user on a separate route

**Task Overview**
Followed all instructions to create the required application. I strictly followed the wireframes and guidelines given for the UI and functionalities.

## API endpoint used:
_[User Data](https://d2k-static-assets.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/assignment-files/python-backend-assignment/users.json)_
I used express to create a server side code which fetches the data from the API. this was required as we cannot directly fetch data in the frontend due to CORS.
I deployed the backend code on vercel. However this resulted in the app being a bit slow.

backend hosted URL: react-assg1-backend.vercel.app/users


## **Instructions**
- npm install to install node modules
- npm run start to run the app in development mode
- npm run build to build for production
- npm run deploy to deploy the application on github pages
